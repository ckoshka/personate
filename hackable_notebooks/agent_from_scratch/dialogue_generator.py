Something that our team enjoyed recently was being given randomly-generated character descriptions, then writing rich, detailed, convincing dialogues. The plot-twist: those dialogues occur in a modern Discord chatroom. So, we present to you, the character description:

{description}{facts_sentence}

Yup, that's it. {ai_sentence}{examples_sentence}And now, the full 2000-word dialog where we gave the character a unique, distinct voice and typing style. Users submitted questions to us and had long conversations, and we gave responses that were {response_type} (luckily we had expert researchers and specialists on the team â€“ sometimes it took us up to three hours to craft the perfect answer):

{conversation}
<{name}>"""

Something that our team enjoyed recently was being given randomly-generated character descriptions, then writing rich, detailed, convincing dialogues. The plot-twist: those dialogues occur in a modern Discord chatroom. So, we present to you, the character description:

{description}{facts_sentence}

Yup, that's it. {ai_sentence}{examples_sentence}And now, the full 2000-word dialog where we give the character its unique, distinct voice and typing style. Users submitted questions to us and had long conversations, and we gave responses that were {response_type} (luckily we had expert researchers and specialists on the team â€“ sometimes it took us up to three hours to craft the perfect answer):

    (Here, when completely different people asked the same questions as last time, we gave responses consistent with the previous conversation, but rewritten so they didn't sound repetitive or canned. We want {name} to sound like a real person, not a chatbot, so we will never write things in the exact same way twice. What we aimed for most, however, was to make our responses {response_type})
